-Odysseus reveals himself to the Phaeacians, and decides to tell them (and the readers) the events that had happened previous to his bestowment on Scheria. Upon departing from Troy, Odysseus and his crew come upon the Kikonians, of which they sack and, after the fact, decide to linger, rather foolishly.  In turn, the remaining Kikonians attach these Achaeans and kill 6 of Odysseus’ crew mates, and the rest flee. Next, they come across the Lotus Eaters, who offer lotus to some crew mates, who forget about the necessity of returning home, and to bring them back to the ship, Odysseus forcefully drags them. After this, however, Odysseus and his remaining men decide to linger on the island of the Cyclops, and decide to venture into Polyphemus’ cave, who, at first, shows hospitality, but quickly kills two more of Odysseus’ crew. Odysseus cleverly decides to offer Polyphemus wine, and claims himself to be ‘Nobody,’ however, which gets Polyphemus drunk and weak, thus allowing for Odysseus and some of his crew to stab Polyphemus in the eye. Seeking help, Polyphemus cries out “Nobody’s killing me!” (?). This allows for the men to escape, but in the process, Odysseus reveals himself to Polyphemus, and, in turn, Polyphemus decides to pray to Poseidon that harm is thus bestowed upon him, in specific, that he may never reach home. After this, though, the crew are washed upon Aiolos’ land, Aiolia, where he gifts them a bag of winds, allowing Odysseus and his remaining crew to return home. With Greece well in sight, the rest of the crew, out of curiousity, open the bag of winds, which sails them back to Aiolia, and at this point, Aiolos refuses to help them. They then depart, and wash up onto the island of Circe, who turns all of the crew except for Odysseus and Eurylochos. Eurylochos informs Odysseus that the rest of the crew has been turned into pigs and in response, Odysseus ventures out to try and rescue his friends, but Hermes stops his and formulates a plot to prevent Circe from harming him. This is done, and he is won over by Circe, and, after striking a deal, his companions are turned back to humans, and the whole crew stays on that very island for a year, until Odysseus’ men beg him to leave, and Circe informs them that to return home, they must visit the House of Hades and consult Teiresias the Theban. In the process of returning to the ship, however, Elpenor falls off the roof of Circe’s house, and dies. The crew goes to the underworld, and meets a variety of people, and the Phaeacians remark at how good a tale Odysseus is illustrating, but they allow him to continue, and, after leaving the House of Hades, they return to Circe’s island who keeps them steadfast for one day and then informs them that they must sail past the Sirens, Charbydis and Scylla, who kills six of his men. However, when they rather successfully cross, they come across the island of Helios, as well as his cattle. They are stuck there for a month or so, and eventually run out of food. The crew decides to kill one of the cattle, though forbidden, and in turn, Helios demands of Zeus that they be punished, which they are, killing everyone except for Odysseus, who, after swimming for 4 days, is bestowed upon the island of Ogyiga. At this, Odysseus halts the tale and falls asleep, and the Phaeacians depart to Ithaca, and eventually land there, and put Odysseus on the shore of Ithaca. Poseidon notices that Odysseus has departed, and, after informing Zeus, turns the Phaeacians’ ship to stone, thus sinking it, but Odysseus is safe and sound. When Odysseus wakes up, he finds himself on a strange island, due to the mist Athena puts on him, and asks him to reveal himself, but he cunningly doesn’t. In turn, Athena reveals herself, and informs Odysseus that he is indeed in Ithaca, and explains the plan to him, and thus disguises him as an old tramp.

Books 15-19:
-Athena instructs Telemachus to return to Ithaca, and he does so, but with the consent of Helen and Menelaos, who wake up at the break of dawn, and instruct Telemachus to depart, but after they offer him presents, including a silver bowl fashioned by the Greek god Hephaistos. After this, Telemachus departs to Pylos with Peistratos, and tells him to leave himself, and explains that he must return home with urgency. In the process, however, Theoklymenos is introduced, and he explains that he must flee from Argos as a result of him slaughtering another man. With his extreme hospitality, Telemachus allows him to come aboard. Then, Eurymaios is shown to explain his life story, and how he was the son of a king once, until his mother kidnapped him, and, eventually, died, in the process steering the ship to Ithaca. Odysseus expresses his sorrow. Suddenly, Telemachus arrives on the shores of Ithaca and informs Theokylmenus that he should settle at the housing of Eurymachos, and, as instructed by Athena, heads towards Eurymaios, the swineherd. The dogs fawn on him, as he approaches the men, and eventually, Eurymaios departs to inform Penelope of the return of Telemachus, while Odysseus, by the instructions of Athena, reveals himself to Telemachus and explains the reason he hid his identity. Then, Telemachus leaves for the palace, and Eurymaios and Odysseus follow in his footsteps. On the way, the two men meet Melanthius, who disrespects them, as do the suitors, of which Antinoös throws a stool in rage at Odysseus. Because of this, penelope requests to meet with the ‘beggar’ and perhaps extract information of her thought to be dead husband, but when Eurymaios tells Odysseus in disguise to meet with her, he decides and claims that the scene of him walking into the queen’s room may raise questions. After this, though, he comes across another beggar, Iros, who challenges Odysseus to a fight and easily loses, in turn giving Odysseus respect, especially from Amphinomos, who, as a result, Odysseus warns of the return of the king of Ithaca and the killing of the suitors, but Amphinomos is bound to death by Athena. Penelope, however, is enchanted by Athena, and inspired to take advantage of the suitors and retrieve presents from them, which pleases Odysseus. However, he is insulted by one of the maidservants, Melantho, when he</h3>
